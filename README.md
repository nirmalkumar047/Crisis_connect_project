## üéØ Problem Statement

During natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, or cyclones, thousands of people are left stranded without timely access to food, clean water, or medical support. Relief efforts often face major challenges due to the lack of real-time visibility of where victims are located and what resources they need most urgently. This results in chaotic distribution, where some areas receive excess aid while others are neglected.
